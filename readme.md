The Minion Masters Game - no offical version!! - Has nothing to do with the real minion world - no commercial use.
Just for testing JavaScript with a fun theme. 

The Game was made with JavaScript - html, css styling and kindly supported by jQuerry. 

The objective of the game is to catch the bananas and level-up your minion. You really should run from the bad-faces
if you donÂ´t want to lose your bananas. 

It is made till the first level for demo reasons, so you will level up very fast. 

The future is to finish some more levels and you will need at least 5 bananas to level-up.

Have fun trying it and please dont hesitate to leave your constructive comments. 

Best regards,
